# Cultural dApps Vision for Anoma

After TGE, how do we keep the Anoma community vibrant, creative, and engaged — beyond the core protocol?  

Here’s a vision for cultural dApps that extend Anoma’s intent-based philosophy into everyday community experiences:

➡️ **AnomaVoices**  
A social storytelling hub where community members can write lore, share narratives, and even record audio versions for those who prefer to listen.  
Gamified with points, upvotes, and feedback loops to keep the culture alive and evolving.

➡️ **Mint Circle**  
A collaborative NFT platform for artists, designers, and creators to launch, curate, and co-create NFT drops.  
Not just minting, but fostering collaboration across disciplines, powered by Anoma’s composability.

➡️ **Wayfindr**  
An intent-based travel dApp. Instead of booking step by step, users simply declare their goal:  
*“I want to go from Lagos to Tokyo under X budget”*.  
Solvers then coordinate flights, accommodation, and routes seamlessly.

## Vision
This isn’t just about apps — it’s about giving the Anoma community spaces to create, share, and explore culture alongside the protocol itself.
